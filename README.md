# DsmxSatBind
Bind module for Spektrum DSMX satellite receivers

Description of bind procedure:

It seems you just have to send a certain number of negative pulses after power-up to activate the bind procedure.
But my sat receivers are still stuck in delivery and I cannot test it.

Documentation from Spektrum does not give any numbers about how long the pulses should be. Have to try this out until someone can give me more insight.
